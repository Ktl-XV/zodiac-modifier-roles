# Getting started

This guide walks you through the basic steps of using the Roles SDK.

## Installation

The Roles SDK relies on [eth-sdk](https://github.com/dethcrypto/eth-sdk) for generating type-safe APIs from automatically downloaded contract ABIs.
To add it to your project, run one of the following commands.

With npm:

```bash
npm i --save @dethcrypto/eth-sdk @dethcrypto/eth-sdk-client zodiac-roles-sdk
```

With yarn:

```bash
yarn add @dethcrypto/eth-sdk @dethcrypto/eth-sdk-client zodiac-roles-sdk
```

With pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @dethcrypto/eth-sdk @dethcrypto/eth-sdk-client zodiac-roles-sdk
```

## Configuration

The next step is to create a config file that lists all the contracts we want to permit calling.

Create a folder named `eth-sdk` in your project root (where your package.json is located).
Inside this folder, create a `config.ts` file with the following content structure:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@dethcrypto/eth-sdk";

export default defineConfig({
  contracts: {
    mainnet: {
      dai: "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f",
    },
  },
});
```

This example lists the [DAI contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f) on Ethereum mainnet.
The object under the `contracts` field should generally list the identifiers of all chains you plan to target.
For each chain entry, you can define arbitrary object structures with addresses stored at the leave values.

**For custom chain configurations:** refer to the [eth-sdk docs](https://github.com/dethcrypto/eth-sdk#configuration) for a complete overview of the available configuration options.

## Generate allow kit

Now, and after any update to the `eth-sdk/config.ts` file, make sure to run the following command:

```bash
yarn eth-sdk
```

This command will fetch the ABIs of the contracts listed in the config file and generate TypeScript types for them directly into your node_modules.
If the ABI of any listed contract cannot be fetched automatically, the command will return an error code.
In that case, you need to manually create a JSON file with the ABI at a location inside `eth-sdk/abi` matching the path of the contract in the `eth-sdk/config.ts` file.

<Callout type="info">
  The VSCode TypeScript server may not automatically pick up the type updates
  generated by the `yarn eth-sdk` command. To ensure the latest state is
  reflected in your IDE, press `CMD`+`SHIFT`+`P` and select "TypeScript: Restart
  TS Server".
</Callout>

## Define permissions

You now have a typed _allow kit_ at your disposal.
Access it by importing from `"zodiac-roles-sdk/kit"`:

```typescript
import { allow } from "zodiac-roles-sdk/kit";

const CURVE_3POOL = "0xbEbc44782C7dB0a1A60Cb6fe97d0b483032FF1C7";

const permissions = [allow.mainnet.dai.approve(CURVE_3POOL)];
```

## Apply permissions

Additional SDK functions allow applying a set of permissions to a role:

```typescript
import { applyPermissions } from "zodiac-roles-sdk";

const calls = applyPermissions(MY_ROLE_KEY, permissions, {
  network: 1,
  address: ROLES_MOD_ADDRESS,
});
```

This will fetch the current permissions configured for the role identified by `MY_ROLE_KEY` and compute the set of calls required to patch it to the new set of `permissions`.
You can execute the calls via ethers or batch them as a multi-send.

ethers:

```typescript
calls.forEach(async (data) => {
  await provider.call({ to: ROLES_MOD_ADDRESS, data }); // signer must be the `owner` of the roles mod
});
```

multi-send:

```typescript
import { encodeMulti } from "ethers-multisend";

const multiSendTx = encodeMulti(
  calls.map((data) => ({ to: ROLES_MOD_ADDRESS, value: 0, data }))
);
```
