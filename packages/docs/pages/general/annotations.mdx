# Annotations

Managing and auditing large sets of permissions can be difficult. To address this challenge, we've introduced the ability to add permission annotations to roles.

An annotation is defined by two fields:

- `uri` - An identifier specifying the subset of permissions to be annotated. A `GET` request to this URI is expected to return an array of permissions.
- `schema` - The URL of an OpenAPI v3 schema document describing the API, including the endpoint specified in `uri`.

Annotations, being an auxiliary concept, are not stored in the Roles contract. Instead, they are posted to the blockchain via [Poster](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3722) to become accessible to the Roles subgraph.

## Resolving Annotations

The Roles app resolves annotations by fetching both the permissions to be annotated from `uri` and the `schema` document.

If the given role is not granted all of the permissions scoped by the annotation, the annotation will be ignored.

From the `schema` document, the Roles app extracts the [Operation object](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) representing the `uri` endpoint.
This information guides the generic rendering of the annotated permission set in the app.

## Example

The [DeFi Kit]() project provides curates permission sets for common interactions with different DeFi protocols.
It uses annotations to indicate which permissions belonging to a certain protocol action.

For example, a `swap` action of the `cowswap` protocol would be annotated as follows:

```json
{
  "uri": "https://kit.karpatkey.com/api/v1/permissions/eth/cowswap/swap?sell=0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F&buy=0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
  "schema": "https://kit.karpatkey.com/api/v1/openapi.json"
}
```

The `uri` includes all parameters of the DeFi Kit action returns the resulting set of permissions:

https://kit.karpatkey.com/api/v1/permissions/eth/cowswap/swap?sell=0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F&buy=0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2

The schema information allows the Roles app to render the annotated permission set in an abstracted, user friendly way:
