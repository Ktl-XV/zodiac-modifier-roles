# Conditions

Zodiac Roles implements a robust conditions system that allows for defining complex conditions over calldata and ether value.

A condition is represented by a tree structure. Each node in the tree defines a condition operator and informs the calldata range it targets. The root node of the tree generally targets the entire calldata range, while children condition nodes allow setting conditions on specific fields of the decoded calldata.

## Node Properties

Each condition node is defined by the following properties:

### `paramType`

Specifies how to pluck the parameter value from calldata. It can be one of the following:

**`Static`** – Interpret the word currently in scope as a static value, i.e., a value with a fixed length padded to 32 bytes.

**`Dynamic`** – Interpret the word currently in scope as an offset to a dynamic length value, i.e., `bytes` or `string`.

**`Tuple`** – Decode the value as a tuple. The `children` condition nodes inform the types of the tuple's fields.

**`Array`** – Interpret the word as an offset to a dynamic length array. The `children` condition nodes inform the array element type.

**`AbiEncoded`** – Decode the value using standard ABI decoding. The `children` condition nodes inform the individual field types.

**`Calldata`** – Decode the value like `AbiEncoded`, but skip the first 4 bytes (function selector).

**`None`** – Used with logical expressions. The `children` condition nodes inform how to interpret the current scope.

### `children`

An array of sub conditions, used for any of the following purposes:

- Inform the decoding of complex types by defining types of their fields or elements (required for `ParamType.AbiEncoded`, `ParamType.Calldata`, `ParamType.Tuple`, `ParamType.Array`)
- Set conditions on specific fields of a tuple type value (via `Operator.Matches`)
- Set conditions on elements of an array type value (via `Operator.ArraySome`, `Operator.ArrayEvery`, `Operator.ArraySubset`)
- Define branch conditions for n-ary logical operators (`Operator.And`, `Operator.Or`, `Operator.Nor`)

### `operator`

Defines the conditional operation to apply to the value plucked from calldata. (Refer to the [Operators](#operators) section for a list of available operators.)

### `compValue`

Defines the value to compare against (only used with comparison operators).

## Operators

### Comparisons

#### `EqualTo`

Checks equality of the plucked value to a given comparison value.

#### `EqualToAvatar`

Equivalent to using `EqualTo` with the avatar address as `compValue`.

This extra operator is provided for convenience and optimization, since comparing with the avatar address is a common operation. The avatar address is available to the condition evaluation function and therefore does not need to be stored as a comparison value.

### `Matches`

Allows setting conditions on selected fields of tuple type parameters.
Used with a `paramType` of `Calldata` it allows setting conditions on specific parameters of the function call.
Used with a `paramType` of `AbiEncoded` it allows setting conditions on selected ABI encoded variables within a bytes value.

### Array Expressions

#### `ArraySome`

Checks that at least one element of the array matches the condition.

#### `ArrayEvery`

Checks that every element of the array matches the condition.

#### `ArraySubset`

Checks that every element of the array passes at least one child condition.
Every child condition must only be taken into account once, meaning that if multiple elements are supposed to match the same condition that condition must appear multiple times in the children.

### Logical Expressions

#### `And`

Checks that every child condition evaluates to `true`.

#### `Or`

Checks that at least one of the child conditions evaluates to `true`.

#### `Nor`

Checks that every child condition evaluates to `false`.

### `Pass`

Allows any value. Used for condition nodes that are required solely for informing how to decode complex type value.

For example, defining the types of all fields of a tuple is necessary for correct decoding.

## Examples

### Balancer swap

The following condition enforces that the Balancer [single swap](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/swaps/single-swap.html#single-swap) function must only be used to swap WETH for DAI and vice versa. Additionally, the sender and recipient for the swap must be set to the avatar address.

<BalancerSwapExample />

The root condition node generally targets the entire calldata range after the 4 bytes function selector. It uses a `ParamType.Calldata` matches structure defining how to decode the bytes in that range.

We define `Operator.Matches` checks on both tuples.

- For `singleSwap` an exact match on the `poolId` fields is required.
- For the `assetIn` and `assetOut` fields, the values must be either `WETH` or `DAI` using `Operator.Or`.
- For `swapInfo` the `sender` and `recipient` fields must be set to the address of the avatar using `Operator.EqualToAvatar`.

This example shows `Operator.Matches` being used to set conditions on specific fields of a tuple type value.

## Custom conditions

Custom conditions can be defined by implementing the `ICustomCondition` interface. For an example of a custom condition, refer to the `AvatarIsOwnerOfERC721.sol` contract.

Importantly, custom conditions must not maintain a state that is updated for every transaction passing through the check. This is because, at the level of the custom condition, there is no way to determine whether or not the transaction will ultimately be executed.
